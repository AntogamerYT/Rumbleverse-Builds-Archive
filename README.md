No, releasing a post-mortem update to break your game won't delete your past.

## Legal requests / contact

Do you have any builds to share with us or do you wanna perhaps sort out any copyright related issues? You can contact me on Discord (`thisisanto`) or send me an email at me@antogamer.it (you will get a reply from another email address as this just forwards everything to my personal email)
