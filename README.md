<p align="center"> No, releasing a post-mortem update to break your game won't delete your past. </p>


Welcome to the first (I think, lol) Rumbleverse builds archive! Every build mentioned here is hosted by me, Anto, on a Cloudflare R2 Bucket

Found a build that isn't mentioned here? Please send me a message via one of my [contact methods](#legal-requests--contact)

*As you may have seen, I suck at styling stuff, if you can make the README better than the current state please open a PR :)*

| #121553  | January 31st 2023 | https://rumbleverse-builds.antogamer.it/121553.zip | Project KO Team | Second last build before the actual shutdown, used by everyone who has made some kind of gameserver before due to it being the last not broken build. |

## Legal requests / contact

Do you have any builds to share with us or do you wanna perhaps sort out any copyright related issues? You can contact me on Discord (`thisisanto`) or send me an email at me@antogamer.it (you will get a reply from another email address as this just forwards everything to my personal email)
